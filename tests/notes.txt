- add cancel upload method
- add pause/resume methods
- Do I need to keep all files regarding of the status? I think it is better to only keep a queue with the files for which
the download didn't start yet. Persistence should be implemented at the application level.
- should I send a progress event when bytesSent == fileSize?
