- in the current design there are two ids: the id generated by the server and the one generated by the upload manager.
The id generated by the upload manager should be sent with any event associated with a file.

- Do I need to keep all files regarding of the status? I think it is better to only keep a queue with the files for which
the download didn't start yet. Persistence should be implemented at the application level.
